Event-driven Server

In this part, a single-threaded server (async-tcpserver.c) that would monitor multiple
sockets for new connections using an event-driven approach, and perform the same 3-way handshake with
many concurrent clients. 

The functionality of this server should be the same as that in multi-threaded server.

Instead of using threads, the select() function are used to monitor multiple
sockets and an array to maintain state information for dif erent clients. Please refer to Beej’s guide
to network programming (http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) on how to use the select() function.

The async-tcpserver.c implementation should still take the same command line arguments as
tcpserver.c. Also, tcp.sh should work as before to start multiple clients to test the server’s concurrency.
